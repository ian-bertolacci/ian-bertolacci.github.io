Jack-of-all trades, master of... well... Computer Science!  
I am currently a Distributed Systems Senior Associate Software Development Engineer at [Workday](https://www.workday.com/).  
I graduated with my M.S. in Computer Science from University of Arizona in 2020.

I'm very interested in compiler and programming language tool development for software engineering.
I believe we should be providing open compiler infrastructure to application developers so that they can analyze and transform their programs with ease.

I've done research on high-performance computing, inter-loop optimizations, compiler transformations, domain specific languages, and performance improvements for legacy scientific applications.
