Jack-of-all trades, master of... well... Computer Science!  
I recently graduated with my M.S. in Computer Science from University of Arizona.  
I am currently working as a Scientific Analyst at the University of Arizona.
[I am available for hire!](/resume_cv)

I currently work in a research lab working on performance improvements for legacy scientific applications.
I've done research on high-performance computing, inter-loop optimizations, compiler transformations, and domain specific languages.

I'm very interested in compiler and programming language tool development for software engineering.
I think that we provide open compiler infrastructure to application developers so that they can analyze and transform their programs with the same ease that we use regular expressions to parse and reformat text.
